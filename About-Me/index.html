		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<P>I'm wise beyond my years even though I don't look it. I love being busy with work or projects to keep my mind motivated and creative.  I'm very adaptable and you can always reley on me to get the job done.</P>
		<p>Spending time with family and friends is important because no one is guaranteed tomorrow. So taking in the good, the bad and the ugly will all make you a better person. Life is too short to waste, so I want to live in every moment.</p>

		<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
		<p>Believe it or not I was born and raised in lovely Phoenix, Arizona. Most natives of Arizona don't stay but as for me, I love it here. Yes it's hot but it's absolutely beautiful all year long.</p>

		<h1>More About Me</h1>
		<h2>What are my favorite hobbies?</h2>
		<p>I love to have fun outside with my two dogs. Seeing them run around and having fun is truely funny. I also love to cook and try new recipes. You never know what you like till you accually try it. I also enjoy coloring and drawing beacuse it relaxes me and I get to see my creative side.</p>
		<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
		<p>My dream job is doing what I love and still having time for my family and friends. I believe if you're fortunate to do what you love, you will enjoy coming to work.</p>
		<h2>If you could travel anywhere in the world where would it be?</h2>
		<p>I have to say that I'm a fan of beaches and places unusual. Poland, Iceland, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Egypt, Brazil, and Singapore are some of the places on my list.</p>
		<h2>Interest Fact</h2>
		<p>My two dog are named <strong>Hershey</strong> and <strong>Kandi</strong>. This was totally by coincidence and they get along great with each other.</p>
